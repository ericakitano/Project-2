# Project-2

 * Author: Erica Kitano


## First choice: dataset 1
1. Source of data: [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

2. Brief description of data: 

   > This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.
   > 
   > Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

3. What is the target?

   > column: 'stroke'

4. What does one row represent? (A person?  A business?  An event? A product?)

   > Patient (person)

5. Is this a classification or regression problem?

   > Classification

6. How many features does the data have?

   > Currently there are 11 other columns besides the target column. 
   >
   > However, after dropping unnnecessary column (e.g. 'id'), the number of feature columns will reduce to 10. 
   >
   > There are 10 features.

7. How many rows are in the dataset?

   > 5110

8. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset?
   > 'bmi' column is missing 201 values.

## Second choice: dataset 2
1. Source of data: [Metabolic Syndrome Prediction](https://data.world/informatics-edu/metabolic-syndrome-prediction)

2. Brief description of data

   > To predict metabolic syndrome, yes or not based on common risk factors
   >
   > Source: https://data.world/informatics-edu/metabolic-syndrome-prediction
   
3. What is the target?

   > MetablicSyndrome

4. What does one row represent? (A person?  A business?  An event? A product?)

   > A person

5. Is this a classification or regression problem?

   > Classification

6. How many features does the data have?

   > 14

7. How many rows are in the dataset?

   > 2401

8. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset?

  > There are missing values in 4 columns: Marital, Income, WaistCirc, BMI.
